-   Little to learn - Pesa sdk should be easy to learn and use as the API is quite small. Most things will still be achievable by users, even if it takes them more code and more time to write. Not having abstractions is better than having the wrong abstractions, and we don't want users to have to hack around the wrong abstractions. Mandatory talk - Minimal API Surface Area.

-   Intuitive abstraction - Users will not feel overwhelmed when looking at the API of a Docusaurus project or adding new features. It should look intuitive and easy to build on top of, using approaches they are familiar with.

-   Sensible defaults - Common and popular performance optimizations and configurations will be done for users but they are given the option to override them.

## How Openpesa works

We believe that as developers, knowing how a library works is helpful in allowing us to become better at using it. Hence we're dedicating effort into explaining the architecture and various components of Docusaurus with the hope that users reading it will gain a deeper understanding of the tool and be even more proficient in using it.
